To run the timings for the mpfr_sum implementation from MPFR 3.1.4,
the new mpfr_sum implementation and a basic sum implementation with
mpfr_add (inaccurate and sensitive to the order of the arguments):

1. Extract the MPFR 3.1.4 tarball.

2. Copy sum-new.c to the src directory.

3. Apply the patch mpfr-sums.patch with "patch -p1".

4. Configure, e.g. with: ./configure CFLAGS="-march=native -O3"

5. make && make check

6. Copy sum-timings.c to the tests directory.

7. Go to the tests directory and run "make sum-timings".

8. Run /path/to/all-timings from the tests directory.

To run the timings only for some mpfr_sum, useful to test various
changes in the trunk:

1. Configure MPFR with the ONLY_SUM macro defined, e.g. with:
   ./configure CFLAGS="-march=native -O3 -DONLY_SUM"

2. Follow steps 5-8 above.

Note: Make sure that hyper-threading is not enabled, otherwise
first remove the "&" at the end of each line of all-timings.
