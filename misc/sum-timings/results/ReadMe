Timings obtained with all-timings on MPFR 3.1.4 patched as described.

Processors: Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2609 v3 @ 1.90GHz
Compiler: gcc (Debian 5.3.1-11) 5.3.1 20160307
Compiler options (CFLAGS): -march=native -O3

Below, ~ means "more or less equivalent", and > means faster, with
several > if it is really much faster.

Summary of the timings with:
  * sum_old: mpfr_sum from MPFR 3.1.4 (old algo).
  * sum_new: mpfr_sum from the trunk patched for MPFR 3.1.4 (new algo).
  * sum_add: basic sum implementation with mpfr_add, inaccurate and
             sensitive to the order of the arguments.

[1] In some cases, sum_new is faster than sum_add.
[2] In some cases, sum_new is much faster than sum_add, or the opposite!

Conclusion:
  * Depending on the cases, sum_new is faster or slower than sum_add.
    The fact that it can be much faster shows the importance of the
    low-level algorithm.
  * In most cases, sum_new is much faster than sum_old. The only cases
    where it is (much) slower is when precy << precx and there is a
    cancellation, due to the fact that the reiterations are always done
    in a small precision, which is regarded as sufficient with a large
    probability. Such pathological cases might be solved in the future
    without much slowing down the common cases thanks to auto-detection,
    but this may need a reallocation.
