<h2 class="chapter">Introduction to MPFR</h2>

<p>MPFR is a portable library written in C for arbitrary precision arithmetic
on floating-point numbers. It is based on the GNU MP library. 
It aims to extend the class of floating-point numbers provided by the
GNU MP library by a precise semantics. The main differences
with the <code>mpf</code> class from GNU MP are:

     <ul>
<li>the <code>mpfr</code> code is portable, i.e. the result of any operation
does not depend (or should not) on the machine word size
<code>mp_bits_per_limb</code> (32 or 64 on most machines);
<li>the precision in bits can be set exactly to any valid value
for each variable (including very small precision);
<li><code>mpfr</code> provides the four rounding modes from the IEEE 754-1985
standard. 
</ul>

   <p>In particular, with a precision of 53 bits, <code>mpfr</code> should be able
to exactly reproduce all computations with double-precision machine
floating-point
numbers (<code>double</code> type in C), except the default exponent range
is much wider and subnormal numbers are not implemented.

   <p>This version of MPFR is released under the GNU Lesser General Public
License. 
It is permitted to link MPFR to non-free programs, as long as when
distributing them the MPFR source code and a means to re-link with a
modified MPFR library is provided.

<h3 class="section">How to use this Manual</h3>

<p>Everyone should read <a href="#MPFR%20Basics">MPFR Basics</a>.  If you need to install the library
yourself, you need to read <a href="#Installing%20MPFR">Installing MPFR</a>, too.

   <p>The rest of the manual can be used for later reference, although it is
probably a good idea to glance through it.

<h2 class="chapter">Installing MPFR</h2>

<p>Here are the steps needed to install the library on Unix systems
(more details are provided in the <code>INSTALL</code> file):

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>To build MPFR, you first have to install GNU MP
(version 4.1 or higher) on your computer. 
You need a C compiler, preferably GCC, but any reasonable compiler should
work.  And you need a standard Unix <code>make</code> program, plus some other
standard Unix utility programs. 
MPFR needs some internal GMP header files that are not installed. 
So, keep the GMP build directory as is, at least until you have
built MPFR.

     <li>In the MPFR build directory, type
<code>./configure --with-gmp-include=GMPBUILD --with-gmp-lib=GMPINSTALL/lib</code>
where <code>GMPBUILD</code> is the GMP build directory and <code>GMPINSTALL</code> the
directory where you have installed GMP. Because of the internal header files
required by MPFR, the option <code>--with-gmp=GMPINSTALL</code> is not sufficient
and should not be used. 
If you get error messages, you might check that you use the same compiler
and compile options as for GNU MP (see the <code>INSTALL</code> file).

     <li><code>make</code>

     <p>This will compile MPFR, and create a library archive file <code>libmpfr.a</code>
in the working directory. No dynamic library is provided yet.

     </p><li><code>make check</code>

     <p>This will make sure MPFR was built correctly. 
If you get error messages, please
report this to <code>mpfr@loria.fr</code>.  (See <a href="#Reporting%20Bugs">Reporting Bugs</a>, for
information on what to include in useful bug reports.)

     </p><li><code>make install</code>

     <p>This will copy the files <code>mpfr.h</code> and <code>mpf2mpfr.h</code> to the directory
<code>/usr/local/include</code>, the file <code>libmpfr.a</code> to the directory
<code>/usr/local/lib</code>, and the file <code>mpfr.info</code> to the directory
<code>/usr/local/info</code> (or if you passed the <code>--prefix</code> option to
<code>configure</code>, using the prefix directory given as argument to
<code>--prefix</code> instead of <code>/usr/local</code>).
        </ol>

   <p>There are some other useful make targets:

     <ul>
<li><code>mpfr.info</code> or <code>info</code>

     <p>Create an info version of the manual, in <code>mpfr.info</code>.

     </p><li><code>mpfr.dvi</code> or <code>dvi</code>

     <p>Create a DVI version of the manual, in <code>mpfr.dvi</code>.

     </p><li><code>mpfr.ps</code>

     <p>Create a Postscript version of the manual, in <code>mpfr.ps</code>.

     </p><li><code>clean</code>

     <p>Delete all object files and archive files, but not the configuration files.

     </p><li><code>distclean</code>

     <p>Delete all files not included in the distribution.

     </p><li><code>uninstall</code>

     <p>Delete all files copied by <code>make install</code>. 
</ul>

<h3 class="section">Known Build Problems</h3>

<p>MPFR suffers from all bugs from the GNU MP library, plus many many more.

   <p>Please report other problems to <code>mpfr@loria.fr</code>. 
See <a href="#Reporting%20Bugs">Reporting Bugs</a>. 
Some bug fixes are available on the MPFR web page
&lt;<code>http://www.loria.fr/projets/mpfr/</code>&gt; or &lt;<code>http://www.mpfr.org/</code>&gt;.

<h2 class="chapter">Reporting Bugs</h2>

<p>If you think you have found a bug in the MPFR library, first have a look on the
MPFR web page &lt;<code>http://www.mpfr.org/</code>&gt; or
&lt;<code>http://www.loria.fr/projets/mpfr/</code>&gt;: perhaps this bug is already known,
in which case you may find there a workaround for it. 
Otherwise, please investigate
and report it. We have made this library available to you, and it is not to ask
too much from you, to ask you to report the bugs that you find.

   <p>There are a few things you should think about when you put your bug report
together.

   <p>You have to send us a test case that makes it possible for us to reproduce the
bug.  Include instructions on how to run the test case.

   <p>You also have to explain what is wrong; if you get a crash, or if the results
printed are incorrect and in that case, in what way.

   <p>Please include compiler version information
in your bug report.  This can be extracted using <code>cc -V</code> on some
machines, or,
if you're using gcc, <code>gcc -v</code>.  Also, include the output from <code>uname
-a</code>.

   <p>If your bug report is good, we will do our best to help you to get a corrected
version of the library; if the bug report is poor, we won't do anything about
it (aside of chiding you to send better bug reports).

   <p>Send your bug report to: <code>mpfr@loria.fr</code>.

   <p>If you think something in this manual is unclear, or downright incorrect, or if
the language needs to be improved, please send a note to the same address.

<h2 class="chapter">MPFR Basics</h2>

<p>All declarations needed to use MPFR are collected in the include file
<code>mpfr.h</code>.  It is designed to work with both C and C++ compilers. 
You should include that file in any program using the MPFR library:
<pre class="verbatim">
#include &lt;mpfr.h>
</pre>

<h3 class="section">Nomenclature and Types</h3>

<p>A <dfn>floating-point number</dfn> or <dfn>float</dfn> for short, is an arbitrary
precision mantissa with a limited precision exponent. The C data type
for such objects is <code>mpfr_t</code>. A floating-point number can have
three special values: Not-a-Number (NaN) or plus or minus Infinity. NaN
represents an uninitialized object, the result of an invalid operation
(like 0 divided by 0), or a value that cannot be determined (like
+Infinity minus +Infinity). Moreover, like in the IEEE 754-1985
standard, zero is signed, i.e. there are both +0 and -0; the behavior
is the same as in the IEEE 754-1985 standard and it is generalized to
the other functions supported by MPFR.

<p>The <dfn>Precision</dfn> is the number of bits used to represent the mantissa
of a floating-point number;
the corresponding C data type is <code>mp_prec_t</code>. 
The precision can be any integer between <code>MPFR_PREC_MIN</code> and
<code>MPFR_PREC_MAX</code>. In the current implementation, <code>MPFR_PREC_MIN</code>
is equal to 2 and <code>MPFR_PREC_MAX</code> is equal to <code>ULONG_MAX</code>/2.

<p>The <dfn>rounding mode</dfn> specifies the way to round the result of a
floating-point operation, in case the exact result can not be represented
exactly in the destination mantissa;
the corresponding C data type is <code>mp_rnd_t</code>.

<p>A <dfn>limb</dfn> means the part of a multi-precision number that fits in a single
word.  (We chose this word because a limb of the human body is analogous to a
digit, only larger, and containing several digits.)  Normally a limb contains
32 or 64 bits.  The C data type for a limb is <code>mp_limb_t</code>.

<h3 class="section">Function Classes</h3>

<p>There is only one class of functions in the MPFR library:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Functions for floating-point arithmetic, with names beginning with
<code>mpfr_</code>.  The associated type is <code>mpfr_t</code>.
        </ol>

<h3 class="section">MPFR Variable Conventions</h3>

<p>As a general rule, all MPFR functions expect output arguments before input
arguments.  This notation is based on an analogy with the assignment operator.

   <p>MPFR allows you to use the same variable for both input and output in the same
expression.  For example, the main function for floating-point multiplication,
<code>mpfr_mul</code>, can be used like this: <code>mpfr_mul (x, x, x, rnd_mode)</code>. 
This
computes the square of <var>x</var> with rounding mode <code>rnd_mode</code>
and puts the result back in <var>x</var>.

   <p>Before you can assign to an MPFR variable, you need to initialize it by calling
one of the special initialization functions.  When you're done with a
variable, you need to clear it out, using one of the functions for that
purpose.

   <p>A variable should only be initialized once, or at least cleared out between
each initialization.  After a variable has been initialized, it may be
assigned to any number of times.

   <p>For efficiency reasons, avoid to initialize and clear out a variable in loops. 
Instead, initialize it before entering the loop, and clear it out after the
loop has exited.

   <p>You don't need to be concerned about allocating additional space for MPFR
variables, since any variable has a mantissa of fixed size. 
Hence unless you change its precision, or clear and reinitialize it,
a floating-point variable will have the same allocated space during all its
life.

<h3 class="section">Compatibility with MPF</h3>

<p>A header file <code>mpf2mpfr.h</code> is included in the distribution of MPFR for
compatibility with the GNU MP class MPF. 
After inserting the following two lines after the <code>#include &lt;gmp.h&gt;</code>
line,
<pre class="verbatim">
#include &lt;mpfr.h>
#include &lt;mpf2mpfr.h>
</pre>

<p>any program written for
MPF can be compiled directly with MPFR without any changes. 
All operations are then performed with the default MPFR rounding mode,
which can be reset with <code>mpfr_set_default_rounding_mode</code>.

<h2 class="chapter">Floating-point Functions</h2>

<p>The floating-point functions expect arguments of type <code>mpfr_t</code>.

   <p>The MPFR floating-point functions have an interface that is similar to the
GNU MP
integer functions.  The function prefix for floating-point operations is
<code>mpfr_</code>.

   <p>There is one significant characteristic of floating-point numbers that has
motivated a difference between this function class and other GNU MP function
classes: the inherent inexactness of floating-point arithmetic.  The user has
to specify the precision for each variable.  A computation that assigns a
variable will take place with the precision of the assigned variable; the
cost of that computation should not depend from the
precision of variables used as input (on average).

   <p>The semantics of a calculation in MPFR is specified as follows: Compute the
requested operation exactly (with "infinite accuracy"), and round the result
to the precision of the destination variable, with the given rounding mode. 
The MPFR floating-point functions are intended to be a smooth extension
of the IEEE 754-1985 arithmetic. The results obtained on one computer should
not differ from the results obtained on a computer with a different word size.

   <p>MPFR does not keep track of the accuracy of a computation. This is left
to the user or to a higher layer. 
As a consequence, if two variables are used to store
only a few significant bits, and their product is stored in a variable with large
precision, then MPFR will still compute the result with full precision.

</div>

<h3 class="section">Rounding Modes</h3>

<p>The following four rounding modes are supported:

     <ul>
<li><code>GMP_RNDN</code>: round to nearest
<li><code>GMP_RNDZ</code>: round towards zero
<li><code>GMP_RNDU</code>: round towards plus infinity
<li><code>GMP_RNDD</code>: round towards minus infinity
</ul>

   <p>The <code>round to nearest</code> mode works as in the IEEE 754-1985 standard: in
case the number to be rounded lies exactly in the middle of two representable
numbers, it is rounded to the one with the least significant bit set to zero. 
For example, the number 5/2, which is represented by (10.1) in binary, is
rounded to (10.0)=2 with a precision of two bits, and not to (11.0)=3. 
This rule avoids the <dfn>drift</dfn> phenomenon mentioned by Knuth in volume 2
of The Art of Computer Programming (Section 4.2.2).

   <p>Most MPFR functions take as first argument the destination variable, as
second and following arguments the input variables, as last argument a
rounding mode, and have a return value of type <code>int</code>, called the
<dfn>ternary value</dfn>. The value stored in the destination variable is
exactly rounded, i.e. MPFR behaves as if it computed the result with
an infinite precision, then rounded it to the precision of this variable. 
The input variables are regarded as exact (in particular, their precision
does not affect the result).

   <p>Unless documented otherwise, functions returning an <code>int</code> return
a ternary value. 
If the ternary value is zero, it means that the value stored in the
destination variable is the exact result of the corresponding mathematical
function. If the ternary value is positive (resp. negative), it means
the value stored in the destination variable is greater (resp. lower)
than the exact result. For example with the <code>GMP_RNDU</code> rounding mode,
the ternary value is usually positive, except when the result is exact, in
which case it is zero. In the case of an infinite result, it is considered
as inexact when it was obtained by overflow, and exact otherwise. A NaN
result (Not-a-Number) always corresponds to an exact return value.

   <p>Here is an example on how to initialize floating-point variables:

<pre class="example">     {
       mpfr_t x, y;
       mpfr_init (x);			/* use default precision */
       mpfr_init2 (y, 256);		/* precision <em>exactly</em> 256 bits */

       /* When the program is about to exit, do ... */
       mpfr_clear (x);
       mpfr_clear (y);
     }
     </pre>

   <p>The following functions are useful for changing the precision during a
calculation.  A typical use would be for adjusting the precision gradually in
iterative algorithms like Newton-Raphson, making the computation precision
closely match the actual accurate part of the numbers.

Convert <var>op</var> to a string of digits in base <var>base</var>, with rounding in
direction <var>rnd</var>. The base may vary
from 2 to 36.

     <p>The generated string is a fraction, with an implicit radix point immediately
to the left of the first digit.  For example, the number 3.1416 would be
returned as "31416" in the string and 1 written at <var>expptr</var>.

     <p>If <var>n</var> is zero, the number of digits of the mantissa is determined
automatically from the precision of <var>op</var> and the value of <var>base</var>. 
Warning: this functionality may disappear or change in future versions. 
Otherwise generate exactly <var>n</var> significant digits, which must be at
least 2.

     <p>If <var>str</var> is a null pointer, space for the mantissa is allocated using
the current allocation function, and a pointer to the string is returned. 
The block will be <code>strlen(s)+1</code> bytes. For more information on how
this block is allocated and how to free it: see <a href="http://www.swox.com/gmp/manual/Custom-Allocation.html#Custom%20Allocation">Custom Allocation</a>.

     <p>If <var>str</var> is not a null pointer, it should point to a block of storage
large enough for the mantissa, i.e., at least <var>n</var> + 2. The extra
two bytes are for a possible minus sign, and for the terminating null
character.

     <p>If <var>n</var> is 0, note that the space requirements for <var>str</var>
in this case will be impossible for the user to predetermine. Therefore,
one needs to pass a null pointer for the string argument whenever
<var>n</var> is 0.

     <p>If the input number is an ordinary number, the exponent is written through
the pointer <var>expptr</var> (the current minimal exponent for 0).

     <p>A pointer to the string is returned, unless there is an error, in which
case a null pointer is returned.

<p>This section describes functions that perform input from an input/output
stream, and functions that output to an input/output stream. 
Passing a null pointer for a <var>stream</var> argument to any of
these functions will make them read from <code>stdin</code> and write to
<code>stdout</code>, respectively.

   <p>When using any of these functions, you must include the <code>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</code>
standard header before <code>mpfr.h</code>, to allow <code>mpfr.h</code> to define
prototypes for these functions.

and <code>mpfr_trunc</code> to the next representable integer towards zero.

     <p>The returned value is zero when the result is exact, positive when it is

the rounding to the nearest mode (where halfway cases are rounded to an even
integer or mantissa). Note also that no double rounding is performed; for
instance, 4.5 (100.1 in binary) is rounded by <code>mpfr_round</code> to 4 (100
in binary) in 2-bit precision, though <code>round(4.5)</code> is equal to 5 and

<h3 class="section">Internals</h3>

<p>The following types and
functions were mainly designed for the implementation of <code>mpfr</code>,
but may be useful for users too. 
However no upward compatibility is guaranteed. 
You may need to include <code>mpfr-impl.h</code> to use them.

   <p>The <code>mpfr_t</code> type consists of four fields. 
The <code>_mpfr_prec</code> field is used to store the precision of
the variable (in bits); this is not less than <code>MPFR_PREC_MIN</code>.

   <p>The <code>_mpfr_size</code> field is used to store the number of
allocated limbs, with the high bits reserved to store
the sign (bit 31), the NaN flag (bit 30),
and the Infinity flag (bit 29);
thus bits 0 to 28 remain for the number of allocated limbs, with a maximal
value of 536870911. 
A NaN is indicated by the NaN flag set, and the other fields are
undefined. 
An Infinity is indicated by the NaN flag clear and the Infinity flag set;
the sign bit of an Infinity indicates the sign, the limb data
and the exponent are undefined.

   <p>The <code>_mpfr_exp</code> field stores the exponent. 
An exponent of 0 means a radix point just above the most significant
limb.  Non-zero values n are a multiplier 2^n relative to that
point.

   <p>Finally, the <code>_mpfr_d</code> is a pointer to the limbs, least
significant limbs stored first. 
The number of limbs in use is controlled by <code>_mpfr_prec</code>, namely
ceil(<code>_mpfr_prec</code>/<code>BITS_PER_MP_LIMB</code>). 
Zeros are represented by the most significant limb being zero, other
limb data and the exponent are undefined (this implies that the
corresponding objects may contain invalid values, thus should not be
evaluated even if they are not taken into account). 
Non-zero values always have the most significant bit of the most
significant limb set to 1.  When the precision does not correspond to a
whole number of limbs, the excess bits at the low end of the data are zero. 
When the precision has been lowered by <code>mpfr_set_prec</code>, the space
allocated at <code>_mpfr_d</code> remains as given by <code>_mpfr_size</code>, but
<code>_mpfr_prec</code> indicates how much of that space is actually used.

<h2 class="unnumbered">Contributors</h2>

<p>The main developers consist of Guillaume Hanrot, Vincent Lef&egrave;vre,
Kevin Ryde and Paul Zimmermann.

   <p>We would like to thank Jean-Michel Muller and Joris van der Hoeven for very
fruitful discussions at the beginning of that project, Torbj&ouml;rn Granlund
and Kevin Ryde
for their help about design issues
and their suggestions for an easy integration into GNU MP,
and Nathalie Revol for her careful reading of a previous version of
this documentation.

   <p>Sylvie Boldo from ENS-Lyon, France,
contributed the functions <code>mpfr_agm</code> and <code>mpfr_log</code>. 
Emmanuel Jeandel, from ENS-Lyon too,
contributed the generic hypergeometric code in
<code>generic.c</code>, as well as the <code>mpfr_exp3</code>,
a first implementation of the sine and cosine,
and improved versions of
<code>mpfr_const_log2</code> and <code>mpfr_const_pi</code>. 
Mathieu Dutour contributed the functions <code>mpfr_atan</code> and <code>mpfr_asin</code>,
David Daney contributed the hyperbolic and inverse hyperbolic functions,
the base-2 exponential, and the factorial function. Fabrice Rouillier
contributed the original version of <code>mul_ui.c</code>, the <code>gmp_op.c</code>
file, and helped to the Windows porting. 
Jean-Luc R&eacute;my contributed the <code>mpfr_zeta</code> code. 
Ludovic Meunier helped in the design of the <code>mpfr_erf</code> code.

   <p>The development of the MPFR library would not have been possible without the
continuous support of LORIA, INRIA and INRIA Lorraine. 
The development of MPFR was also supported by a grant
(202F0659 00 MPN 121) from the Conseil R&eacute;gional de Lorraine in 2002.

<h2 class="appendix">GNU Free Documentation License</h2>

<div align="center">Version 1.1, March 2000</div>
<pre class="display">     Copyright &copy; 2000 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307, USA
     
     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
     </pre>

     <ol type=1 start=0>
<li>PREAMBLE

     <p>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
written document <dfn>free</dfn> in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone
the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without
modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.  Secondarily,
this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get
credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
modifications made by others.

     <p>This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

     <p>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

     </p><li>APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     <p>This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a
notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed
under the terms of this License.  The "Document", below, refers to any
such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a licensee, and is
addressed as "you".

     <p>A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

     <p>A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject
(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
within that overall subject.  (For example, if the Document is in part a
textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

     <p>The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.

     <p>The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.

     <p>A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage
subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.  A copy that is
not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     <p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
<small>ASCII</small> without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
<small>SGML</small> or <small>XML</small> using a publicly available
<small>DTD</small>, and standard-conforming simple <small>HTML</small> designed
for human modification.  Opaque formats include PostScript,
<small>PDF</small>, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
proprietary word processors, <small>SGML</small> or <small>XML</small> for which
the <small>DTD</small> and/or processing tools are not generally available,
and the machine-generated <small>HTML</small> produced by some word
processors for output purposes only.

     <p>The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     </p><li>VERBATIM COPYING

     <p>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

     <p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.

     </p><li>COPYING IN QUANTITY

     <p>If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100,
and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose
the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition. 
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

     <p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

     <p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete
Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the
general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the latter
option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this
Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location
until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque
copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to
the public.

     <p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

     </p><li>MODIFICATIONS

     <p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

          <ol type=A start=1>
<li>Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
if the original publisher of that version gives permission.

          <li>List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
Document (all of its principal authors, if it has less than five).

          <li>State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
Modified Version, as the publisher.

          <li>Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

          <li>Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
adjacent to the other copyright notices.

          <li>Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.

          <li>Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.

          <li>Include an unaltered copy of this License.

          <li>Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and add to
it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
there is no section entitled "History" in the Document, create one
stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
Version as stated in the previous sentence.

          <li>Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section. 
You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.

          <li>In any section entitled "Acknowledgments" or "Dedications",
preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all the
substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgments
and/or dedications given therein.

          <li>Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

          <li>Delete any section entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
may not be included in the Modified Version.

          <li>Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements"
or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
          </ol>

     <p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. 
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

     <p>You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

     <p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

     <p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

     </p><li>COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     <p>You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice.

     <p>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. 
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

     <p>In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled "History"
in the various original documents, forming one section entitled
"History"; likewise combine any sections entitled "Acknowledgments",
and any sections entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections
entitled "Endorsements."

     </p><li>COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     <p>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

     <p>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

     </p><li>AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     <p>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version
of the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the
compilation.  Such a compilation is called an "aggregate", and this
License does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled
with the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they
are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     <p>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter
of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that surround only the Document within the aggregate. 
Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate.

     </p><li>TRANSLATION

     <p>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. 
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License provided that you also include the
original English version of this License.  In case of a disagreement
between the translation and the original English version of this
License, the original English version will prevail.

     </p><li>TERMINATION

     <p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to
copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,
parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

     </p><li>FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     <p>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</a>.

     <p>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. 
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
        </ol>

<h3 class="appendixsec">ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents</h3>

<p>To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

<pre class="smallexample">       Copyright (C)  <var>year</var>  <var>your name</var>.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with the Invariant Sections being <var>list their titles</var>, with the
       Front-Cover Texts being <var>list</var>, and with the Back-Cover Texts being <var>list</var>.
       A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.
     </pre>

   <p>If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant Sections"
instead of saying which ones are invariant.  If you have no
Front-Cover Texts, write "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of
"Front-Cover Texts being <var>list</var>"; likewise for Back-Cover Texts.

   <p>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.
